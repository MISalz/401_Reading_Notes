[List Comprehensions](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/list-comprehensions-in-python)

Create a List with range() -method to generate a list of numbers. Python iterates(or loops) through each item in that range, and saves a copy of the item in a new list called digits.

Create a List Using Loops and List Comprehension in Python

list comprehensions reduce the code necessary to complete rather complicated task when working with a list.

Multiplying Parts of a List
Adding a filter to the list comprehension allows for greater flexibility. By using filters, we can select certain items from the list, while excluding others. This is an advanced feature of lists in Python.

Show the first letter of each word using Python
List comprehensions can make solving issues involving strings much easier using simplified expressions. These methods can save time and precious lines of code.

Lower/Upper case converter using Python
Using list comprehension to loop through a string in Python, it’s possible to convert strings from lower case to upper case, and vice versa. 

Print numbers only from a given string
Taking advantage of Python’s isdigit() method, we can extract the phone number from the user data

parsing a file using list comprehension
It’s also possible to read files in Python using list comprehension. 

Using functions in list comprehensions
So far we’ve seen how to use list comprehension to generate lists using some basic Python methods like lower() and upper().
