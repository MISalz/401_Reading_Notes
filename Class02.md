[In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python](https://code.likeagirl.io/in-tests-we-trust-tdd-with-python-af69f47e6932)

Create small tests to determine if your code will work   
use descriptive names- this can be considered your documentation   
The test file should have the same name as your original file.   
Structure your tests correctly: Example:

A convention widely used is the **AAA: Arrange, Act and Assert.**   
**Arrange:** you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input);   
**Act:** here you will execute the code being tested (exercise the behaviour);   
**Assert:** after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting.   

### The cycle
made by three steps:   
üÜò Write a unit test and make it fail (it needs to fail because the feature isn‚Äôt there, right? If this test passes, call the Ghostbusters, really)   
‚úÖ Write the feature and make the test pass! (you can dance after that)   
üîµ Refactor the code ‚Äî the first version doesn‚Äôt need to be the beautiful one (don‚Äôt be shy)   

[If name equals main](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-does-the-if-__name__-__main__-do/)

A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended. 

Every Python module has it‚Äôs __name__ defined and if this is ‚Äò__main__‚Äô, it implies that the module is being run standalone by the user and we can do corresponding appropriate actions.   
If you import this script as a module in another script, the __name__ is set to the name of the script/module.
Python files can act as either reusable modules, or as standalone programs.   
if __name__ == ‚Äúmain‚Äù: is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported.


[Recursion](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recursion/)

The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function.

[What on Earth is Recursion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv9NEXX1VHc)

**still confused but basically function that calls it self and cannot return a response until it reaches the end of the stack then works backwards until the end of the stack resolves to the first part of it.
