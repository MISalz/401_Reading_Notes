[Classes and Objects](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Classes_and_Objects)

Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.

[Thinking Recursively](https://realpython.com/python-thinking-recursively/)

If the current problem represents a simple case, solve it. If not, divide it into subproblems and apply the same strategy to them.

A Recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions.

This means that the function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result. All recursive functions share a common structure made up of two parts: base case and recursive case.

You can create multiple different objects that are of the same class(have the same variables and functions defined). However, each object contains independent copies of the variables defined in the class. 

to access a function inside of an object you use notation similar to accessing a variable:

the __init__() function, is a special function that is called when the class is being initiated.


Optional: Naive Recursion is Naive section and beyond
