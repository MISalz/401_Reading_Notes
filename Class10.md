[Implementation: Stacks and Queues](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/resources/stacks_and_queues.html
)

Some ideas for how you might want to teach:

Use an analogy
Explain a detail in depth
Use WHY, WHAT, HOW structure
Tutorial / walk through an example
Write a quiz
Create a vocabulary/definition list
Write a cheat sheet
Create a diagram / visualization / cartoon of a topic
Anthropomorphize the concepts, and write a conversation between them
Build a map of the information
Construct a fill-in-the-blank worksheet for the topic
