Implementation: Graphs

To turn in your reading “Reply” to this discussion by teaching something that you learned. Then review what one of your classmates learned, and leave a comment.

Definition List
<ol>
<li>Graphs - A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.</li>
<li>Vertex  -  A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.</li>
<li>Edge  -  An edge is a connection between two nodes.</li>
<li>Neighbor  -  The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.</li>
<li>Degree  -  The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.</li>
<li>Undirected Graph  - is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.</li>
<li>Directed Graph -  also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.</li>
<li>Complete Graphs - A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.</li>
<li>Connected - A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.</li>
<li>Disconnected - A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.</li>
<li>Acyclic Graph - An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles.</li>
<li>Cyclic Graphs - A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles.</li>
<li>Adjacency Matrix - An Adjacency matrix is represented through a 2-dimensional array. If there are n vertices, then we are looking at an n x n Boolean matrix</li>
<li>sparse graph -  is when there are very few connections.</li>
<li>dense graph  - is when there are many connections</li>
<li>Adjacency List - An adjacency list is the most common way to represent graphs.</li>
<li>Weighted Graphs - A weighted graph is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These numbers are called weights. </li>
<li>Traversals - is a process to visit all the nodes of a tree and may print their values too. </li>
<li>Breadth First - Breadth first traversal is when you visit all the nodes that are closest to the root as possible. From there you traverse outwards, level by level, until you have visited all the vertices/nodes.</li>
<li>enqueue  - the declared start node into the Queue.</li>
<li>Dequeue  - the first node from the queue</li>
<li>Depth First - he depth first traversal uses a Stack to visit all children of a given subtree. </li></ol>
