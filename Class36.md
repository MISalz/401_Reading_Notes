To turn in your reading “Reply” to this discussion by teaching something that you learned. Then review what one of your classmates learned, and leave a comment.

Some ideas for how you might want to teach:

Use an analogy
Explain a detail in depth
Use WHY, WHAT, HOW structure
Tutorial / walk through an example
Write a quiz
Create a vocabulary/definition list
Write a cheat sheet
Create a diagram / visualization / cartoon of a topic
Anthropomorphize the concepts, and write a conversation between them
Build a map of the information
Construct a fill-in-the-blank worksheet for the topic
