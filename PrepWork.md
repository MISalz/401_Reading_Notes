### [Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset.](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?language=en)

This video was interesting, the reward mindset has been questions for years. the thought process of rewarding for good behavior versus participation and attempt behavior.

This video relates back to Growth Mindset. How does one measure postive outcome in education? Is it by IQ, Income, Surroundings?

### [Alain de Botton on Redefining Success.](https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success)

Alain talks about creating your own version of reality. What others may think is success may not be your own thoughts on what success is. Do not conform to the idea that you are sucessful by others standards. Instead measure your own sucess by what you believe is the best outcome for you.

### [Assess your emotional intelligence.](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching/201/emotional-intelligence-assessment.html)

I score high in Self awareness(22), Social Awareness(20) and Self Management (19). I agree with these results and in relationship management (14) is where I am already aware I need to improve. My social skills lack due to being a bit introverted and having to navigate alot of my teen/young adult life on my own. Ive always been someone who just identifies problems but rather work on resolving them myself. I shy away from others because of feeling intimidated. 

### [Assess your biases.](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching/301/bias-assessment.html)

I have high sense of self awareness as well as bias. I also understand that we are all guilty of conscious and unconscious bias so it is something we should continue to be aware of. For me being a minority i understand how bias affects me on multiple levels so it helps to sympathize and understand its effects on others.

# Introduction to SQL

I already had experience with SQL but I was unaware of the limit and offset. The use of these operators to filter data will help me in the future when working with large data sets.
