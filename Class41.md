### Ethics in the workplace
[The code I’m still ashamed of](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e)

This article made me thing of a movie I saw some months ago that had same dilema. You may create something that could be useful to alot of people and may save lives. But theres always a second side of the story where in the wrong hands it could actually hurt many others. I often think about scientists who often research and create experiments with good intentions but many times have seen that their hard work ends up being missused. Honestly theres nothing you can do about that. This article I think we will all relate to because you may have to decided between your job and income to your morals. Thats if you catch it. If you dont then you may end up not even seeing the pros and cons and may end up building something you will not be able to forsee its future use.

[Big Data is our Civil Rights issue](http://solveforinteresting.com/big-data-is-our-generations-civil-rights-issue-and-we-dont-know-it/)
This article really speaks to me because if been really hesitant of having too much of my data out there for the world to see. But in realiaty we live in an age where no matter what you do even take a prescription, go the hospital or even use social media your bound to have information that gets shared. Theres no way to completly exclude yourself from bigdata and most of the time the waivers, the innocent waivers you share end up including some fine print of we may share your data such as race, ethnicity and sex for research purposes. But in reality we dont know that this is actuall what happens.
